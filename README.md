# Project

This is a project to study Ansible, Telemetry and Grafana.

I'm using 3 Arista devices, 3 Nokia SRLinux and 2 Cisco IOS.

For now just have basic ansible playbooks.

# Lab

I'm using Containerlab to deploy

` run clab deploy -t lab.clab.yaml `

## Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:

- `ansible/`: directory containing Ansible playbooks and roles.
  - `playbooks/`: directory containing the playbooks.    
  - `roles/`: directory containing Ansible roles.
   


## How to Run

To run the basic playbook, follow these steps:

1. Make sure you have Ansible installed on your machine and use the ansible.cfg and hosts.yaml.
